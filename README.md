# You-Just-Got-CPZoned-  

About:

LeetCode has always been a goto platform for each and every coder out there.
Same is the case for me. So, I tried to create to make it a bit easier to just prepare a excel sheet of the desired problems (tagname) so that it could be easy to just store every problem offline incase we are unable to filter out.

# Project Setup

Windows, Linux and Mac OS X 

    Download The Repository in a Zip file and Unzip all the Contents
    Setup a Virtual Environment and activate it
    Run the command pip install -r requirements.txt in your shell
    Run the command python webscraper.py tagname
    We can find the desired tagname under the **tagList.csv** file

Advantages:
    
    Gets us to prepare a offline list and available with links to access the problems when required.
    Easily shareable to our colleagues and friends if required.
